            <p>
                The most intriguing part of the internet is how there aren’t many common rules to follow. Instead,
                there are protocols put in place that help people understand how they should be managing their own
                physical and intangible devices. A <b>protocol</b> is a well-known set of rules and standards used to help
                machines communicate between each other. Because the internet is a large network of networks, the
                billions of devices it links must follow a protocol in order to function properly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every device has an <b>IP Address</b>, which is a number related to the device in order to reach it. This is
                similar to that of a home address.To send and receive messages to that location, you must know their
                full street address. Same goes for sending and receiving messages from another device, as you must know
                the second party’s IP address. You, the physical human, do not have to know the IP address, but a
                device such as a computer or smartphone knows how to interact with other devices.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>IP</b> stands for <b>Internet Protocol</b>, so an IP address is the address which follows this protocol. A standard
                <b>IPv4</b> address is thirty-two bits long (thirty-two digits of either 1 or 0). The bits earlier in the
                address specify a larger area, such as a country or region, while the later bits narrow down the area.
                <b>IPv6</b> addresses are slowly being implemented and will contain 128 bits. IPv6 is being implemented now
                because we are quickly running out of IPv4 addresses with the amount of devices we use.
            </p>
            <p>
                Information is sent online from address to address in many individual information packets. A <b>Packet</b> is
                a very small piece of information sent from one device that travels over the course of many routers.
                Packets are designed to always take the best (fastest) route from the sending address to the receiving
                address. This logic is what is referred to as <b>Routing</b>.
