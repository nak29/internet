            <p>
                The invention of the World Wide Web did not take the world by storm as one might assume, as the
                technology was not user friendly. Only experienced tech-geeks with formidable backgrounds can
                successfully navigate the internet in its primitive state. That was until the first web browser was
                released in 1993, named Mosaic. Mosaic wasn’t anything like modern day web browsers, but at the time,
                it was a revolutionary addition to personal computers. Web browsers were able to take heaps of large
                data stored on the internet and condense them into easy (or at least easier) to digest subsections.
            </p>
            <p>
                As time progressed, more web browsers were being developed, the most notable of the era being
                “Navigator” developed by Netscape. Although you don’t hear much about them anymore, Netscape’s web
                browser was a huge success; some would say the release of Navigator was the beginning of the Internet
                Age. However, Netscape was soon going to find one major downside of success: competition.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the previous tech-corporate goliath, Microsoft wanted what Netscape had. As Netscape reached one
                million downloads, Bill Gates sent an email to his associates calling to “match and beat” their new
                competitor. Microsoft had a meeting with Netscape, and offered to buy their whole company for $1
                million. This seems like a great offer on paper, until it is understood that Microsoft would copy
                Netscape’s browser if they refused. To combat Microsoft’s threat, Netscape decided to go public on
                the stock market in August 1995 so they could acquire the funds to fight back. This turned out to be
                a huge success, as Netscape’s IPO went through the roof, peaking at around $75 per share.
            </p>
            <p>
                Netscape’s success would only last so long, because in December of 1995, Microsoft announced the
                development of their new web browser, Internet Explorer. Over time, Microsoft’s browser overpowered
                the Navigator browser with their infinite connections and tactics, such as not allowing Netscape to
                run on the Windows operating system, and drove Netscape to halt operations in September 1997. Later
                down the line a lawsuit took place that attempted to hold Microsoft accountable, which concluded with
                little to no success. Microsoft’s Internet Explorer had won the Browser Wars.
